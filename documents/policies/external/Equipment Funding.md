# WCA Equipment Funding Policy

### Version 2.0 {.version}

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to offer a set of procedures by which the WCA can invest in the equipment necessary to run WCA Competitions for countries or regions where their own ability to obtain equipment is hindered by financial or other hardship. 

## Policy
### Qualifying Equipment
The following equipment is covered by the policy:

1. Officially recognized timing equipment
   1. Timers
   2. Mats
   3. Displays
   4. Accessories (data cords, power supplies, brackets)
2. Other equipment required by the Regulations 
   1. Stopwatches
   2. Cube covers
3. Consumable equipment
   1. Batteries
   2. Ink/Toner
   3. Pens
4. Other competition equipment
   1. Laptops
   2. Printers
   3. Equipment for transporting other equipment (bins, hand trucks, etc.)

### Eligibility
Competition equipment will only be funded by the WCA when there is strong evidence that the Delegates for a country or region lack the financial resources to purchase competition equipment themselves and that registration fees cannot reasonably be used to purchase  competition equipment without substantial hardship for competitors. 

### Approval Process
An application for funding must be submitted by a WCA Delegate or acknowledged WCA Regional Organization, outlining the following: 

1. A list of the equipment they currently have access to. 
2. A list of the qualifying equipment they wish the WCA to purchase on their behalf.
3. For all equipment that is not officially recognized timing equipment, the cost of the equipment along with documentation of the cost.
4. An explanation of why they are not able to purchase the equipment themselves.
5. An estimate of how often the equipment will be used for WCA Competitions. 
6. The WCA Staff or Regional Organization who will act as custodian for the equipment. 

The WCA Financial Committee (WFC) will evaluate the application, asking for assistance from the WCA Board of Directors, other WCA Committee or Teams, WCA Staff Members, or outside sources as needed. Once the application has been researched and considered, the WFC will vote on whether to fund the requested equipment fully, partially, or not at all. The WFC will then inform the applicant of the decision.

The funding decision for each application will be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the merits of the application and the amount of funding allocated for equipment in the annual budget approved by the WCA Board of Directors.

### Procurement
The method of obtaining the equipment will vary.

All officially recognized timing equipment will be purchased directly by the WCA and delivered to the applicant.

For all other equipment, the WCA will use one of the following options based on the type of equipment and the applicant’s situation:

1. Purchasing the equipment directly and having it delivered to the applicant.
2. Reimbursing the applicant for purchasing the equipment themselves. In this case, the applicant must provide all receipts for the equipment purchase within 30 days of making the purchase in order to be reimbursed.
3. Making an advance of funds to the applicant for purchasing the equipment themselves. In this case, the applicant must purchase the equipment, provide all receipts, and refund any funds not used for the equipment purchase within 30 days of receiving the advance. Failure to use the funds for the purpose they have been provided may lead to WCA disciplinary procedures and/or legal action.

### Equipment Custodian
The WCA will remain the owners of the purchased equipment and reserves the right to require its return (at the expense of the WCA) at any time. However, a custodian will be appointed to hold, maintain, and care for the equipment. A custodian must be a WCA Staff Member, a WCA Trainee Delegate, or an acknowledged WCA Regional Organization.

Risk for any loss or damage to the equipment passes to the custodian upon delivery. Equipment custodians are expected to take proper care of equipment (though regular wear and tear is expected) and track it if it is loaned to another Delegate or organizer. 

All WCA-funded equipment must only be used for WCA Competitions or activities that promote speedcubing in the community and align with the WCA’s mission statement, spirit, and goals. Any other use of the equipment requires the express written permission of the WCA Financial Committee.

Failure to return the equipment in a timely fashion upon request or returning the equipment in unsatisfactory condition may result in WCA disciplinary procedures and/or legal action.

4. The WFC will create and approve a spending plan to allocate the total funding available for the application period. Some applications may only receive partial funding in the spending plan in order to provide funding to more applicants.
5. Within 4 weeks of the end of the application period, the WFC will notify all applicants whether their application will be fully funded, partially funded, or not funded.
